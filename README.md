# Motifit

## Goal
To create a motivation for students and teachers to improve their own health.
We will do this by making IoT systems that can measure the amout of people taking the stairs on the campus.
With this data we will do a few things to make students and teachers more aware of their behaviour:
* Show the amount of people that have taken the stairs (week/month/year)
* Set and show goals for weeks, months and year.
Optional:
* Show a comparison between different buildings and departments to improve competition

## design requirements 
For this project we will use the folliwing hardware:

Phothons:
* Detecting people on the stairs (Pressure detectors or infrared lights and detectors)
* Show the current status (screens or servo poiting to a percentage)

All the data will be saved on the phothons themselves.
